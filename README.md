# Bachelor Thesis
Deep Learning Algorithms Applied to Blockchain-Based Financial Times Series (FTS).

## 1. Practice Exercises
### Exercises 1 & 2: AR, ARMA & ARIMA
These exercises investigate linear AR, ARMA & ARIMA models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 3: ARCH & GARCH
This exercise investigates linear ARCH & GARCH models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 4: MLP & NN
This exercise investigates non-linear Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) & basic Neural Networks (NN) and their performance for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 5: NNetAR 
This exercise investigates Single Hidden Layer Neural Networks (NNetAR algorithm) and their performance for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 6: SOM
This exercise investigates Self Organising Maps (SOM) and their performance in unsupervised learning.

### Exercise 7: Forex vs. BTC (binary prediction only)
This exercise investigates applying the AR, ARMA, ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH, SLP, MLP, NN, NNetAR & SOM models to both Forex & BTC FTS.

## 2. Mathematical Fundamentals 
These equations cover the bare fundamentals of all the models used.
