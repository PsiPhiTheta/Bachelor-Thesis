# Bachelor-Thesis
Applying ML principles to predicting Financial Time Series (FTS).

## Exercise 1 & 2
These exercises investigate linear AR, ARMA and ARIMA models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

## Exercise 3
This exercise investigates linear ARCH and GARCH models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

## Exercise 4
This exercise investigates non-linear Multi Layer Perceptron (ML) and Neural Networks (NN) and their performance for modelling FTS.

## Mathematical Fundamentals 
These equations cover the bare fundamentals of all the models used.
