# Bachelor Thesis
Deep Learning Algorithms Applied to Blockchain-Based Financial Times Series (FTS).

## 1. Practice Exercises
### Exercise 1: AR Yule-Walker, AR Burg
This exercise investigates linear AR Yule-Walker and AR Burg models applied to FTS prediction.

### Exercise 2: ARMA & ARIMA
These exercises investigate linear ARMA & ARIMA models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 3: ARCH & GARCH
This exercise investigates linear ARCH & GARCH models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 4: SLP & NN
This exercise investigates non-linear Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) & basic Neural Networks (NN) and their performance for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 5: NNetAR 
This exercise investigates Single Hidden Layer Neural Networks (NNetAR algorithm) and their performance for modelling FTS.

### Exercise 6: SOM (Animals)
This exercise investigates Self Organising Maps (SOM) and their performance in unsupervised learning.

### Exercise 7: Forex vs. BTC 
This exercise investigates the differences in applying the AR, ARMA, ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH & SLP models to Forex & BTC FTS (binary only).

### Exercise 8: NARMAX
This exercise investigates applying the Nonlinear Auto Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs (NARMAX) to both predicting Forex & BTC FTS (trend & binary).

### Exercise 9: SOM (BTC/Forex)
This exercise investigates Self Organising Maps (SOM) and their performance in unsupervised learning applied to Forex & BTC FTS.

### Exercise 10: ESN (BTC/Forex)
This exercise investigates Echo State Networks (ESN) and their performance in unsupervised learning applied to Forex & BTC FTS.

### Exercise 11: Granger Causality (cryptocurrencies)
This exercise investigates Granger Causality in cryptocurrencies.
