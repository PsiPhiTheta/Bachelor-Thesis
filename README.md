# Bachelor-Thesis
Applying ML principles to predicting Financial Time Series (FTS).

## Exercises 1 & 2
These exercises investigate linear AR, ARMA and ARIMA models applied to FTS prediction and why linear models are not necessarily the most suited for modelling FTS.

## Mathematical Fundamentals 
These equations cover the bare fundamentals of all the models used.
